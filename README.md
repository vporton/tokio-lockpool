# tokio-lockpool

**Analog of [`lockpool`](https://github.com/smessmer/lockpool) for Tokio - NOT READY FOR USE (WORK ABANDONED)**

This library offers a pool of locks where individual locks can be locked/unlocked by key.
It initially considers all keys as "unlocked", but they can be locked
and if a second thread tries to acquire a lock for the same key, they will have to wait.

```rust
use lockpool::LockPool;

let pool = LockPool::new();
let guard1 = pool.lock(4)?;
let guard2 = pool.lock(5)?;

// This next line would cause a deadlock or panic because `4` is already locked on this thread
// let guard3 = pool.lock(4)?;

// After dropping the corresponding guard, we can lock it again
std::mem::drop(guard1);
let guard3 = pool.lock(4)?;
```

You can use an arbitrary type to index locks by, as long as that type implements [PartialEq] + [Eq] + [Hash] + [Clone] + [Debug].

```rust
use lockpool::LockPool;

#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Clone, Debug)]
struct CustomLockKey(u32);

let pool = LockPool::new();
let guard = pool.lock(CustomLockKey(4))?;
```

Under the hood, a [LockPool] is a [HashMap](std::collections::HashMap) of [Mutex](std::sync::Mutex)es, with some logic making sure there aren't any race conditions when accessing the hash map.
